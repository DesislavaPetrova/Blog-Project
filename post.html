                        <p>Hi! I’m Desi. Starting from a young age I loved building models and structures, drawing and experimenting with different forms, materials and techniques. Through the years those passions 
                        of mine have translated into an interest in Web Design and Front-end development. And now I’m currently working on pursuing a career in this field.
